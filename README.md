The project involves representing the wavefunction as a linear combination of product of wavelets along the x, y and z direction, and constructing the real symmetric Hamiltonian matrix in wavelet basis. The potential, which is in terms of 1/r is represented as a sum of gaussians, and the kinetic energy elements are calculated using overlap integrals. I have calculated the energy eigenvalues for a small range of x, y and z using Daubechies wavelets of level 3 have been obtained, and my current work lies in using high performance cluster, where I can increase my number of grid points, the range and order of Daubechies wavelet for a higher accuracy in results
