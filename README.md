# Solving the Schr√∂dinger equation for the Hydrogen atom using Daubechies Wavelet Basis
This project deals with solving the Schrodinger equation of a hydrogen atom in Cartesian form using
Daubechies wavelet basis. Doing so, this problem becomes an eigenvalue
problem ,where eigenvalues are the energy levels of the the system,whereas
the eigenvectors are the coefficients of the wavelet basis functions using which,
we can reconstruct the wave function. The number of eigenvalues obtained or
the size of the Hamiltonian matrix will depend on the domain chosen, i.e the
range of position coordinates , along x,y and z axis that can be spanned by
the basis set. The lowest eigenvalue corresponds to ground state energy,where
on taking h and m as 1, we get the value as -0.5Ha.
